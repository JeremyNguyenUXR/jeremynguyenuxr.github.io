## Overview

This is a course long project for a UX research course to develop and demonstrate my research skills learnt through out the semester. Our goal was to solve a problem on campus and conduct research to develop the most suitable solution to the problem. My role in this project was to **proudly lead the primary and secondary research where I recruited and conducted interviews on all 20 participants, facilitate workshops**, and aid in UI designing.

### My Role
- Testing facilitator
- UI Designer

### Timeline
- 12 weeks  

### Tools
- Balsamiq

### User Observations, Analysis: User Needs and Pains


### Qualitative and Quantitative Observations
We began the project with observational research at home, examining how our families and friends used their phones and engaged in physical activity. We organized our findings into qualitative and quantitative insights. Overall, we noticed high screen time, brief breaks, and a shared lack of motivation for physical activity. I then facilitated a workshop to create affinity diagrams, helping our team clarify patterns and define the design requirements for our prototype.

### Design Requirements and Prototyping

Once we established a clear direction for our app, we outlined the functional and technical requirements that would guide our design. Functionally, we focused on supporting users’ schedules, fitness goals, and motivation, assuming a basic level of digital literacy. From a technical standpoint, we aimed to make the app free, cloud-based for flexible storage, and compatible with common devices and app stores. These requirements shaped the first iteration of our wireframes.

Below is the first iteration of our app's first wireframes.

### Heuristic Evaluation: Trial Test

Before our first usability test, a peer conducted a heuristic evaluation of our wireframes to identify obvious issues. We found problems such as cluttered pages, unclear button paths, and confusing elements like a skip button. To address these, we simplified page layouts, added missing wireframes, and refined functionality—for example, replacing the skip button with clearer “back” and “next” options. With these improvements in place, we moved on to our first usability testing session.

### Usability Testing Session #1 Evaluation, Protocol, and Scenarios

For our prototype, I developed the testing procedure for our first usability session. This included a background questionnaire, scenario walkthroughs, free-hand notes, a UI evaluation form, and a post-test questionnaire. Overall, users responded positively, but they found the exercise wireframe confusing and poorly organized, and the equipment wireframe unclear in both purpose and layout. After organizing the results into a Task Completion Rates table, we revised our wireframes accordingly, removing unnecessary screens and improving the exercise and equipment pages based on user feedback.

Below is our testing scenarios and redesigned wireframes

### Usability Testing Session #2

For our second usability session, I updated the testing scenarios to focus on other key features, such as the scheduling tool. Most elements of the app were well received, but the exercise wireframe remained a major pain point. Users continued to struggle with the resting feature and had difficulty demonstrating how they would use it. Based on this feedback, we further refined and developed the exercise wireframe to improve clarity and usability.

### Usability Testing Session #3 

For our final usability session, I refined the testing scenarios again—this time focusing on the sharing feature, since our research showed users spend a significant amount of time on social media. By this stage, the exercise wireframe and rest feature were much easier for users to navigate, with far fewer issues. Overall, the app was well received, with only minor confusion remaining around the sharing feature and calendar. From these insights, I recommended smaller UI adjustments to finalize the design.

Below are the updated wireframes and test scenario.

### Next Steps

We believe the app could continue to improve with additional usability testing and future iterations of the design. If developed as a real product, it would eventually require testing on actual digital devices. Before reaching that stage, more wireframes and evaluations would be needed to address features we haven’t yet explored, such as language options and text size or readability settings. Since the app is intended for laptops and other devices as well, separate wireframes and usability tests would also be necessary to ensure a consistent and accessible experience across platforms.
