# Hi, I’m Jeremy 👋

## UX Researcher & Designer focused on human-centered, evidence-driven design

I’m a UX researcher and designer with a background in human–computer interaction and user research. I enjoy translating complex user needs into clear, usable design solutions through research synthesis, wireframing, and iterative testing.

My work is grounded in **empathy, clarity, and thoughtful problem framing** — whether I’m conducting interviews, facilitating workshops, or refining interactions through usability testing.

## How I work

- I start by **listening** — understanding user goals, pain points, and context  
- I synthesize research into **clear insights** using frameworks like personas, affinity maps, and journey maps  
- I design and iterate through **wireframes and prototypes**, validating decisions with real users  

My background in education has shaped how I communicate ideas, facilitate collaboration, and design with accessibility in mind.
