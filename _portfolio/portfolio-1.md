## Overview

This is a course long project for a UX research course to develop and demonstrate my research skills learnt through out the semester. Our goal was to solve a problem on campus and conduct research to develop the most suitable solution to the problem. My role in this project was to **proudly lead the primary and secondary research where I recruited and conducted interviews on all 20 participants, facilitate workshops**, and aid in UI designing.

### My Role
- Workshop facilitator
- Researcher
- UI Designer

### Timeline
- Overall 12+ weeks
- Discovery & research: 10 weeks
- Design & Testing: 2 weeks  

### Tools
- Figma
- Balsamiq
- Figjam
- Studiobinder

## The Problem

In-door navigation around the University of Toronto Mississauga campus has proved to be a challenge for first-year students and visitors. With the current resources such as signs and web-apps not being able to suffice or not being known at all, most occupants rely on verbal directions from strangers to find rooms or risk being late. Our most significant problem was accurately identify the most significant user pain points and envision the best solution. Our goal was to have a wireframe prototype by the end of the semester while still keeping deadlines with stake holders.

## Process

### Secondary Research

After the project kickoff, we defined our research strategy and objectives. Understanding the target audience and their challenges were our priority. First, we conducted competitor research on other universities and how they handled navigation around campus to learn from their strengths and weaknesses. Next we viewed what resources UTM had for navigation and analyzed all the drawbacks that it had.

From this research we were able to direct our primary research into more accurately finding user pain points as well as gather some examples for ideation.

### Primary Research

During the research phase, I conducted 13 in-person user interviews and created an online survey to inform our personas and design direction. Our team developed a 10-question interview script focused on users’ values, motivations, and daily routines, and we referenced these insights throughout the design process.

The 12-question survey was shared with UTM communities and received 7 responses in just a few days. Together, the interviews and survey revealed key pain points that guided our next steps.

We found that most students relied on peers to navigate campus due to confusing signage, and many were unaware of or unable to locate campus facilities. Confident navigation was largely limited to experienced upper-year students.

Below you will see examples of our questions, process, and data

### Analysis and Findings

To make sure that our solutions is aligned with user expectations, I lead 3 remote card sorting sessions using Figjam. The types of card sorting we used were As-Is and To-Be, Affinity Maps, and Empathy Maps. Our goal was to create new personas and find smaller, intuitive groupings for the existing pain points to better understand our users. After organizing the data, we ended up 2 distinct personas as well as a better understanding of the users mental model when navigating campus. These card sorting sessions helped guide our design for the solution.

Below is the results of our card sorting workshops and the 2 personas we created

### Ideation

After analyzing our findings and having a better understanding of our users I conducted further card sorting sessions to brainstorm ideas with my group members. These card sorting sessions consisted of "Big Ideas" where we categorized a multitude of ideas, "Hills" that showed us how our solution could work, and finally "Prioritization Grid" that showed the feasibility of our solutions via cost and impact. Based on these sessions we were able to distinguish which ideas would be the most helpful to implement as well as practical. After this our group settled on 3 main solutions.

Below is the outcome of our card sorting sessions

### Further Research

Although the 3 ideas were all feasible to implement and solve the issue our group was split mostly between a mobile/web app that could give real time directions to your destination, similar to Google Maps, and digital kiosks based off ones seen in malls to navigate stores and finally a third option to reconcile both solutions. To decide our solution we conducted another interview with a group of students to make an informed decision. In a group of 6 students 4 sided with a web-app and 2 sided with kiosks.

The table beside shows the pros and cons of each idea listed above.

## Design and Implementation

After deciding on a digital interface our group divided the features it would have between "Must-have-features" and "Nice-to-have Features". We focused on the Must-have features in our prototype. These features included:

- Indoor maps of campus buildings
- Wayfinding
- Facility exploration/information

The Nice-to-have features included:
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Augmented Reality Features
- Room Info and Schedule

Below you will see images regarding information of our prototype including information architecture, wireframes and more.

## Next Steps

Because of time limits and difficulty finding participants at the end of the term, a larger sample size was not possible. Future research should include more UTM students as well as other potential users and stakeholders. User testing on the wireframes would also help identify any navigation or usability issues and allow for further design improvements. If time and resources permit, additional features such as indoor positioning or augmented reality could also be explored.
